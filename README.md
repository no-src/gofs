A cross-platform file synchronization tool out of the box based on golang.

## Installation

The first need [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed (**version 1.18+ is required**), then you can use the below
command to install `gofs`.

```bash
go install github.com/no-src/gofs/...@latest
```

### Run In Docker

You can use the [build-docker.sh](/scripts/build-docker.sh) script to build the docker image and you should clone this
repository and `cd` to the root path of the repository first.

```bash
$ ./scripts/build-docker.sh
```

Or pull the docker image directly from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nosrc/gofs) with the command below.

```bash
$ docker pull nosrc/gofs
```

For more scripts about release and docker, see the [scripts](/scripts) directory.

### Run In the Background

You can install a program run in the background using the following command on Windows.

```bat
go install -ldflags="-H windowsgui" github.com/no-src/gofs/...@latest
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Please ensure the source directory and dest directory exists first, replace the following path with your real path.

```bash
$ mkdir source dest
```

Generate the TLS cert file and key file for testing purposes.

The TLS cert and key files are just used by [File Server](#file-server) and [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server).

```bash
$ go run $GOROOT/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --host 127.0.0.1
2021/12/30 17:21:54 wrote cert.pem
2021/12/30 17:21:54 wrote key.pem
```

Look up our workspace.

```bash
$ ls
cert.pem  key.pem  source  dest
```

### Local Disk

Monitor source directory and sync change files to dest directory.

You can use the `logically_delete` flag to enable the logically delete and avoid deleting files by mistake.

Set the `checkpoint_count` flag to use the checkpoint in the file to reduce transfer unmodified file chunks, by
default `checkpoint_count=10`, which means it has `10+2` checkpoints at most. There are two additional checkpoints at
the head and tail. The first checkpoint is equal to the `chunk_size`, it is optional. The last checkpoint is equal to
the file size, it is required. The checkpoint offset set by the `checkpoint_count` is always more than `chunk_size`,
unless the file size is less than or equal to `chunk_size`, then the `checkpoint_count` will be zero, so it is optional.

By default, if the file size and file modification time of the source file is equal to the destination file, then ignore
the current file transfer. You can use the `force_checksum` flag to force enable the checksum to compare whether the
file is equal or not.

The default checksum hash algorithm is `md5`, you can use the `checksum_algorithm` flag to change the default hash
algorithm, current supported algorithms: `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, `crc32`, `crc64`, `adler32`, `fnv-1-32`
, `fnv-1a-32`, `fnv-1-64`, `fnv-1a-64`, `fnv-1-128`, `fnv-1a-128`.

If you want to reduce the frequency of synchronization, you can use the `sync_delay` flag to enable sync delay, start
sync when the event count is equal or greater than `sync_delay_events`, or wait for `sync_delay_time` interval time
since the last sync.

```bash
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest
```

### Sync Once

Sync the whole path immediately from source directory to dest directory.

```bash
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest -sync_once
```

### Sync Cron

Sync the whole path from source directory to dest directory with cron.

```bash
# Per 30 seconds sync the whole path from source directory to dest directory
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest -sync_cron="*/30 * * * * *"
```

### Daemon Mode

Start a daemon to create subprocess to work, and record pid info to pid file.

```bash
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest -daemon -daemon_pid
```

### File Server

Start a file server for source directory and dest directory.

The file server is use HTTPS default, set the `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` flags to customize the cert file and
key file.

You can disable the HTTPS by set the `tls` flag to `false` if you don't need it.

If you set the `tls` to `true`, the file server default port is `443`, otherwise it is `80`, and you can customize the
default port with the `server_addr` flag, like `-server_addr=":443"`.

If you enable the `tls` flag on the server side, you can control whether a client skip verifies the server's certificate
chain and host name by the `tls_insecure_skip_verify` flag, default is `true`.

You should set the `rand_user_count` flag to auto generate some random users or set the `users` flag to customize server
users for security reasons.

The server users will output to log if you set the `rand_user_count` flag greater than zero.

If you need to compress the files, add the `server_compress` flag to enable gzip compression for response, but it is not
fast now, and may reduce transmission efficiency in the LAN.

```bash
# Start a file server and create three random users
# Replace the `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` flags with your real cert files in the production environment
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest -server -tls_cert_file=cert.pem -tls_key_file=key.pem -rand_user_count=3
```

### Remote Disk Server

Start a remote disk server as a remote file source.

The `source` flag detail see [Remote Server Source Protocol](#remote-server-source-protocol).

Pay attention to that remote disk server users must have read permission at least, for
example, `-users="gofs|password|r"`.

You can use the `checkpoint_count` and `sync_delay` flags like the [Local Disk](#local-disk).

```bash
# Start a remote disk server
# Replace the `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` flags with your real cert files in the production environment
# Replace the `users` flag with complex username and password for security
$ gofs -source="rs://127.0.0.1:8105?mode=server&local_sync_disabled=true&path=./source&fs_server=https://127.0.0.1" -dest=./dest -users="gofs|password|r" -tls_cert_file=cert.pem -tls_key_file=key.pem
```

### Remote Disk Client

Start a remote disk client to sync change files from remote disk server.

The `source` flag detail see [Remote Server Source Protocol](#remote-server-source-protocol).

Use the `sync_once` flag to sync the whole path immediately from remote disk server to local dest directory,
like [Sync Once](#sync-once).

Use the `sync_cron` flag to sync the whole path from remote disk server to local dest directory with cron,
like [Sync Cron](#sync-cron).

Use the `force_checksum` flag to force enable the checksum to compare whether the file is equal or not,
like [Local Disk](#local-disk).

You can use the `sync_delay` flag like the [Local Disk](#local-disk).

```bash
# Start a remote disk client
# Replace the `users` flag with your real username and password
$ gofs -source="rs://127.0.0.1:8105" -dest=./dest -users="gofs|password"
```

### Remote Push Server

Start a [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server) as a remote file source, then enable the remote push server with
the `push_server` flag.

Pay attention to that remote push server users must have read and write permission at least, for
example, `-users="gofs|password|rw"`.

```bash
# Start a remote disk server and enable the remote push server
# Replace the `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` flags with your real cert files in the production environment
# Replace the `users` flag with complex username and password for security
$ gofs -source="rs://127.0.0.1:8105?mode=server&local_sync_disabled=true&path=./source&fs_server=https://127.0.0.1" -dest=./dest -users="gofs|password|rw" -tls_cert_file=cert.pem -tls_key_file=key.pem -push_server
```

### Remote Push Client

Start a remote push client to sync change files to the [Remote Push Server](#remote-push-server).

Use the `chunk_size` flag to set the chunk size of the big file to upload. The default value of `chunk_size`
is `1048576`, which means `1MB`.

You can use the `checkpoint_count` and `sync_delay` flags like the [Local Disk](#local-disk).

More flag usage see [Remote Disk Client](#remote-disk-client).

```bash
# Start a remote push client and enable local disk sync, sync the file changes from source path to the local dest path and the remote push server
# Replace the `users` flag with your real username and password
$ gofs -source="./source" -dest="rs://127.0.0.1:8105?local_sync_disabled=false&path=./dest" -users="gofs|password"
```

### Relay

If you need to synchronize files between two devices that are unable to establish a direct connection, you can use a
reverse proxy as a relay server. In more detail, see also [Relay](/relay/README.md).

### Remote Server Source Protocol

The remote server source protocol is based on URI, see [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html).

#### Scheme

The scheme name is `rs`.

#### Host

The remote server source uses `0.0.0.0` or other local ip address as host in [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server)
mode, and use ip address or domain name as host in [Remote Disk Client](#remote-disk-client) mode.

#### Port

The remote server source port, default is `8105`.

#### Parameter

Use the following parameters in [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server) mode only.

- `path` the [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server) actual local source directory
- `mode` running mode, in [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server) mode is `server`, default is running
  in [Remote Disk Client](#remote-disk-client) mode
- `fs_server` [File Server](#file-server) address, like `https://127.0.0.1`
- `local_sync_disabled` disabled [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server) sync changes to its local dest path, `true`
  or `false`, default is `false`

#### Example

For example, in [Remote Disk Server](#remote-disk-server) mode.

```text
 rs://127.0.0.1:8105?mode=server&local_sync_disabled=true&path=./source&fs_server=https://127.0.0.1
 \_/  \_______/ \__/ \____________________________________________________________________________/
  |       |       |                                      |
scheme   host    port                                parameter
```

### Manage API

Enable manage api base on [File Server](#file-server) by using the `manage` flag.

By default, allow to access manage api by private address and loopback address only.

You can disable it by setting the `manage_private` flag to `false`.

```bash
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest -server -tls_cert_file=cert.pem -tls_key_file=key.pem -rand_user_count=3 -manage
```

#### Profiling API

The pprof url address like this

```text
https://127.0.0.1/manage/pprof/
```

#### Config API

Reading the program config, default return the config with `json` format, and support `json` and `yaml` format
currently.

```text
https://127.0.0.1/manage/config
```

Or use the `format` parameter to specific the config format.

```text
https://127.0.0.1/manage/config?format=yaml
```

#### Report API

Use the `report` flag to enable report api route, and start to collect the report data, need to enable the `manage` flag
first.

The details of the report api see [Report API](/server/README.md#report-api).

```text
https://127.0.0.1/manage/report
```

### Logger

Enable the file logger and console logger by default, and you can disable the file logger by setting the `log_file` flag
to `false`.

Use the `log_level` flag to set the log level, default is `INFO`, (`DEBUG=0` `INFO=1` `WARN=2` `ERROR=3`).

Use the `log_dir` flag to set the directory of the log file, default is `./logs/`.

Use the `log_flush` flag to enable auto flush log with interval, default is `true`.

Use the `log_flush_interval` flag to set the log flush interval duration, default is `3s`.

Use the `log_event` flag to enable the event log, write to file, default is `false`.

Use the `log_sample_rate` flag to set the sample rate for the sample logger, and the value ranges from 0 to 1, default
is `1`.

Use the `log_format` flag to set the log output format, current support `text` and `json`, default is `text`.

```bash
# set the logger config in "Local Disk" mode
$ gofs -source=./source -dest=./dest -log_file -log_level=0 -log_dir="./logs/" -log_flush -log_flush_interval=3s -log_event
```

### Use Configuration File

If you want, you can use a configuration file to replace all the flags.It supports `json` and `yaml` format currently.

All the configuration fields are the same as the flags, you can refer to the [Configuration Example](/conf/example)
or the response of [Config API](#config-api).

```bash
$ gofs -conf=./gofs.yaml
```

### Checksum

You can use the `checksum` flag to calculate the file checksum and print the result.

The `chunk_size`, `checkpoint_count` and `checksum_algorithm` flags are effective here the same as in
the [Local Disk](#local-disk).

```bash
$ gofs -source=./gofs -checksum
```
